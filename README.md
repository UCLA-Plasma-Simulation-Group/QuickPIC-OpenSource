QuickPIC is a 3D parallel (MPI & OpenMP Hybrid) Quasi-Static PIC code, which is developed based on the framework UPIC. QuickPIC can efficiently simulate plasma based accelerator problems. This is the UCLA Plasma Simulation Group's official open-source repository for QuickPIC.

# Upon cloning the repository

If you clone this repository, we ask that you __please contact__ Weiming An (anweiming@ucla.edu). The development of QuickPIC relies on grant funding for which we are required to report code usage, and we would greatly appreciate being able to maintain accurate user-number tallies.

Please feel free to join in our email list [quickpic-users-developers](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.ucla.edu/forum/#!forum/quickpic-users-developers). We also have created a chat room “QuickPIC-User-Developer-Community” on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/home).
